Hi everyone, this is a short presentation on the iccv 2021 paper
"practical relative order attack in deep ranking".

The corresponding preprint is avaiable on arxiv, and the code is avaialble on github.

Now let's look at the background. deep ranking is based on deep metric learning.
and previous works suggest that these models are vulnerable to adversarial attacks,
where the ranking result can be drammatically changed.

however, the previous attacks only focus on changing the absolute rank, namely
the absolute positions of the selected candidates, while neglecting the possibility
to change the relative order among the selected candidates.

in this paper, we propose order attack to manipulate the relative order.

specifically, a triplet-style loss function is proposed for the white-box order attack.

and for black-box order attack, a short-range ranking correlation is proposed as
a surrogate objective to approximate the triplet-style formulation.

so, what is order attack?

Assume we have a query image as the input to the deep ranking model, and the
top-5 candidates in the ranking reuslt is a, b, c, d, e.

then the attacker can specify a descired permutation for the five candidates,
and apply order attack to change their relative order into, for example,
a, e, d, c, b.

In applications such as online shopping based on search-by-image, order
attack could impact the click-through rate and hence influence the sales.
